   - `featuredProperties` → API call to fetch properties
   - `locations` → API call to fetch available locations
   - `developers` → API call to fetch developer list
   - `projects` → API call to fetch project list

   - Property search API
   - Property details API
   - Contact form submission
   - User authentication (if needed)

3. **Database Schema** (suggested):
   ```sql
   Properties: id, title, location, price, type, bedrooms, area, developer_id
   Developers: id, name, logo, description
   Locations: id, name, city, pincode
   Projects: id, name, developer_id, location_id
